# Manage git branches between local and remote,
# since git is so incredibly inept at that.
# Also figure out whether a repo needs to be pushed upstream.

# Uses python-git package on Debian.

# Choices for git in python on Debian seem to be: python-git, python-pygit2,
# and python-dulwich. Dulwich doesn't have any docs on examining things
# like branches; it's all about creating and committing files.
# python-git seems like the best, and seems to correspond to
# the (rather incomplete) docs at
# http://gitpython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html
# http://gitpython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference.html
