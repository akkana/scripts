Helpers for working on development versions of GIMP,
or for working with GIMP files and formats.

buildgimp:
    Shell script for GIMP's ridiculously complicated build.

gimprun:
    Run a locally built version of GIMP, setting all needed environment
    variables first.

gimpapidocs:
    Generate HTML documentation from GIMP .gir files.

xcfprobe.py:
    Print the layers in an XCF image.
    Mostly useful as a proof of concept of analyzing (some versions of)
    XCF from a non-GIMP Python script.
