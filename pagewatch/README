Check a web page, summarizing just the specific part you care about.
Uses selenium so that JavaScript and dynamically loaded pages work.

For instance, if you're trying to buy a car and the manufacturer
has a page showing inventory for a particular zip code and set of options,
but you're willing to travel or to accept several combinations of options,
you can monitor several pages to see what comes up, and email yourself
the results each day or create an RSS file for it.

Since pages vary so much, and you might need to do things like search
for the list of things and then loop through the things, you'll need
to write the part that actually parses the page as a loadable module.
Basically, create a file named yourmodulename.py that defines a function
named summarize(driver). Your summarize function is responsible for
loading the URL(s), parsing them using the selenium driver passed in,
and doing something useful (perhaps just print()) with the results.

If you get selenium errors in driver initialization, try making a
virtualenv where you can pip install selenium before giving up.
Distro seleniums (at least on Debian) are sometimes broken.
