mapping/demraytrace.py:
    Raytrace a Digital Elevation Model file using povray,

    or full moon around solstices and equinoxes. Meant to show how
    easy it is for alignments to happen accidentally.

speedtestserver:
    A mini http server that can introduce delays or other glitches
    that are useful for testing http download clients.
    Unfortunately, it's only single-threaded which makes it
