Take standalone HTML files and add customized headers and footers
to make them fit in with a website, replacing anything up to and
including <body> and following and including </body>.
(So your template should include <body> and </body>.
This is so your template can include the title as both
<title> and <h1>.)

This is useful if someone keeps sending you Word documents;
word2html can convert them, but this can help fit them into a
website. Can apply different headers/footers depending on the file's
location in the filesystem.

Configuration: create a directory ~/.config/headerfooter. In it,
create files with names corresponding to directory names where you
want files matched.

For example, if you keep files in a directory called myweb,
create a file named ~/.config/headerfooter/myweb.
Inside it, put your desired header and footer, separated
by two empty lines. (If you actually want two empty lines
in your HTML file, sorry, you're out of luck.)
If there aren't two empty lines in the file, the whole file
will be presumed to be a header, and no footer will be added.

headerfooter will try to figure out a page title from the content.
In your template, use $TITLE for any place you'd like this title
to be inserted.
