--------------------------
Astronomy-related scripts.
--------------------------

analemma.py:
    Plot the analemma from the selected location, using PyEphem and PyGTK.

comet.py:
    Look up a comet and compute its position, using Skyfield.

conjunctions.py:
    Predict planetary visibility and conjunctions for a specified
    date range.

daynightimage.py:
    Given two rectangular Earth (or other planet) images, for day and night,
    generate a combined image for a given time, especially
    solstices and equinoxes.
    The images can be viewed as-is or wrapped around a globe.

equisolstice.py:
    Print the next four equinox/solstice events, plus local
    sunrise/sunset times on those days.

epicycles.py:
    Show planet orbits as they would be viewed from the north ecliptic
    pole in a geocentric universe. Show the Venus Pentagram, etc.

hypermoon.py:
    Make up silly names for tonight's moon, as a CGI.

moonpos:
    Predict when the moon (or another body) will be at a specified
    altitude and azimuth during a specified time window.

marsoppy.py:
    Print and plot Mars oppositions using PyEphem.
    Also an example of how to use the TkInter Canvas with persistent objects.

oppretro/:
    Subdirectory: Several different programs to examine Mars' orbit,
    and also to experiment with various astronomy libraries. See
    oppretro/README.md for more details.

skyalignments.py:
    Starting from points in a GPX file, find all combinations of
    those points that line up with the rising or setting of the sun
    or full moon around solstices and equinoxes. Meant to show how
    easy it is for alignments to happen accidentally.

starstack.py:
    Use the astroalign module to align and stack astrophotography images.
