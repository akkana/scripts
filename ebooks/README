Scripts for working with e-books and Kobo ebook readers

epubtag.py:
    Display author, title and tag information for ebooks in epub format;
    or add or modify an ebook's topic tags, title or cover.
    Can be imported as a module (there are examples in the kobo/ directory
    and in fixbookcover).

fixbookcover.py:
    Fix books whose cover doesn't include the title, like many
    Project Gutenberg books.

fixlines.py:
    Apply a line-length heuristic to fix books converted by Calibre's
    ebook-convert, which even with --heuristics makes a new double-
    spaced paragraph for every line in the PDF.

grebook.sh:
    A shell script adapted from one by mosh on Stack Exchange
    to grep in un-DRMed epub (and presumably also mobi) ebooks.

grebook.py:
    A Python version of grebook, mainly useful to show how to implement
    a multi-stage command pipeline in Python.

kobocopy.py:
    Copy a list of epub files or directories, mirroring directory structure,
    koboizing each file before copying,     to a dest directory
    (typically where you have your kobo mounted).

koboize.py:
    Convert epub to kepub, which works much better on Kobo ebook readers:
    the pager is more responsive, you can see pages left in chapter, etc.

mirror2kobo.py:
    From a directory structure of epub files, create a parallel structure
    with all the same files, same create and modify dates, but with
    files converted for Kobo's .kepub.epub format.
