Scripts for working with e-books and Kobo ebook readers

epubtag.py:
    Display author, title and tag information for ebooks in epub format;
    or add or modify an ebook's topic tags, title or cover.
    Can be imported as a module (there are examples in the kobo/ directory
    and in fixbookcover).

fixbookcover.py:
    Fix books whose cover doesn't include the title, like many
    Project Gutenberg books.

grebook.sh:
    A shell script adapted from one by mosh on Stack Exchange
    to grep in un-DRMed epub (and presumably also mobi) ebooks.

grebook.py:
    A Python version of grebook, mainly useful to show how to implement
    a multi-stage command pipeline in Python.
