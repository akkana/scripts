Mapping and GIS Related Scripts:
--------------------------------

demraytrace.py:
    Raytrace a Digital Elevation Model file using povray,
    creating a 360-degree panorama.
    demproj.py is similar but pointless, making lots of smaller
    povray projections that you can stitch together.

geoipcompare.py:
    Check several different geoip services and log the varying
    answers they give.

geojsonmap.py:
    How to plot a geojson file of polygons exported from QGIS.

grassviewshed.py:
    Use GRASS r.viewshed for a viewshed analysis on a DEM input file.

greatcircle.py:
    Calculate bearings for a great circle trip between two coordinates
    on a spherical planet.

polidistmap.py:
    Show political districts -- or any other geojson data -- on a map
    using folium to create a leaflet map.
    Also has examples for using gdal to translate shapefile to geojson.

shapemerge.py:
    Starting from a shapefile of lots of small shapes, merge (dissolve)
    them into a smaller number of shapes. For instance, coalesce
    voting precincts into voting districts each containing several
    precincts. Uses fiona and shapely.

viewshed2view.py:
    Take a viewshed (like one generated by GRASS r.viewshed) and
    turn it into a 360 image showing what's visible.

waymaker.py:
    Take a file and of descriptions, multi-line and separated by blank lines,
    and turn it into a collection of GPX waypoints suitable for import into
    any mapping program (e.g. Osmand or PyTopo).
